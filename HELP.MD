This is the help file.

You basically just attack tons of randomly generated monsters that progressively get harder every time you level up.

To do this you have the stats to help you to see these stats you can press i in a battle.
Attack - How much damage the player/enemy does when they attack
Defense - How much damage is blocked when the enemy attacks the player and the player defends and vice versa.
health - The amount of hitpoints the enemy/player has.
maxHealth - Only the player has this and it says how much the player will heal when the player levels up.
level - This shows what level you are and is used to calculate the enemy stats
XP - This used to calculate when to level up you need 5 XP for level 1, 10 for level 2, 15 for level 3, etc
Now for the confusing ones
runChanceStart - When the enemy hits this many hitpoints the chance for running away starts
runChanceIncrease - This is how much the chance increases every time the enemy loses another hitpoint after hitting runChanceStart
