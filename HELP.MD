You basically just attack tons of randomly generated monsters that progressively get harder every time you level up.



<h2>These are all the stats which you can access by pressing i in most locations.</h2>

Attack - How much damage the player/enemy does when they attack

Defense - How much damage is blocked when the enemy attacks the player and the player defends and vice versa.

health - The amount of hitpoints the enemy/player has.

maxHealth - Only the player has this and it says how much the player will heal when the player levels up.

level - This shows what level you are and is used to calculate the enemy stats

XP - This used to calculate when to level up you need 5 XP for level 1, 10 for level 2, 15 for level 3, etc

Now for the confusing ones

runChanceStart - When the enemy hits this many hitpoints the chance for running away starts

runChanceIncrease - This is how much the chance increases every time the enemy loses another hitpoint after hitting runChanceStart

gold - How much gold you have



<h2>These are the items in the shop</h2>

Health Potions - They cost 10 gold and heal you 10 health they can not heal you past your max health
