<h1> Notes on Issues and Pull requests </h1>
Always have only a single change or issue in each one so instead of saying add potions, say add health potion.


<h1/>What branch to contribute on</h1>
Contribute on the main branch new features and bug fixes for the next release and on the bug fix branch bugfixes for the latest stable version.

Ex: latest release is v0.2 so put bug fixes for that version into bugfixes but if you are working on a new feature for v0.3 put that into main.
